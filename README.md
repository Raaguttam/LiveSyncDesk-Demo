# LiveSyncDesk-Demo
LiveSyncDesk is an independent project under active development. It's a general-purpose collaboration board where you can Draw together, upload images and sync with zoom or focus to explain and discuss the same image in real time together. LiveSync Desk is a real-time collaborative visual workspace designed for shared drawing, teaching, discussion, and synchronized interaction across devices and locations.

# LiveSyncDesk (WebRTC):
The project focuses on human-centered real-time presence, not just data sync — combining canvas interaction, live updates, and communication layers into a single shared desk experience.

✨ Core Vision
LiveSync Desk is built around one simple idea:
When people interact visually in real time, the system should disappear.
The goal is to make collaboration feel natural — like standing around the same desk — whether users are students, teachers, collaborators, or remote teams.

🧩 Key Capabilities (in progress)
Real-time shared board (drawing & interaction)
Multi-user synchronization
WebRTC-based communication experiments
Socket-based event syncing
Lightweight, responsive UI for desktop & mobile
Progressive Web App (PWA) foundations

🕒 Project Timeline Note
The concept, design, and core development of LiveSync Desk began earlier (approx. Oct–Nov 2025).
The project is under active development with Testing phase, but already useful in many ways.

🔧 Development Status
This project is actively evolving.
Features are added iteratively after real-world testing rather than predefined roadmaps.
Expect:
refactors
architectural changes
experimental modules

🚀 Philosophy
LiveSync Desk is not an ERP, LMS, or generic collaboration tool.
It is designed as a:
real-time presence space,
visual thinking desk,
shared attention environment,
Technology serves interaction — not the other way around.
